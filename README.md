# Build Week 1 - April 15, 2019 - Tipsease
Deployed At: https://eloquent-lewin-bbf0d3.netlify.com/home2.html#

## Tipsease - What We Built
Tipsease is a way for customers to tip service employees directly to ensure that the employee receives the full tip without any employer interference. The possible allure to businesses is that the tip is something that could be handled separately from their core business by a third party (Tipsease).

## Tipsease Marketing Page
During this build week, Chris Petito (WEB19, Lambda School Build Week 1) built out the Tipsease marketing page to explain the purpose and functionality of Tipsease. The marketing website consisted of four pages:
- Home
- About Us
- Pricing
- Log In/Sign Up

### Home Page
The **Home Page** is the elevator pitch to both customers and businesses. It explains why Tipsease is a viable product, and why it would be an extremely useful tool to businesses and product to customers. It explains it is powered by Stripe, includes an Android mobile app screenshot, and includes a Sign Up button at the bottom of the page that links to the react app.

### About Us
The **About Us** page consists of a list of team members, a photo of each team member, each team member name, and each team member role on the Tipsease project. It also includes a link to each member GitHub profile.

### Pricing 
The **Pricing** page is a mock pricing page that includes what the Tipsease product might be priced for. It includes a column for both customers and merchants, and list of product features, and the corresponding cost for each feature.

### Log In/Sign Up
The **Log In/Sign Up** page consists of a mock password and email field, as well as three buttons: a Log In button, a Sign Up button, and a Explore Pricing button. The Log In and Sign Up buttons link to the react app, and Explore Pricing button links to the Pricing page.

### Mobile and Tablet Views
All four pages have been formatted to be responsive to both mobile (500px) and tablet (800px) views, in addition to desktop (>1000px).
